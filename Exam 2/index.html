           Order of Assassin were founded by mysterious individual known to Outsiders
           as the <i>Old Man Of The Mountain</i> or he has known as <i>Hassan i-Sabbah</i>.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;
          After succesion crisis in the fatimid caliphate, a powerful ismaali shia Muslim dynasty that
          ruled much of north Africa in the Middle East. The succesion crisis was in Cairo it took place
          between two of the Caliphate princess, the eldest of the two princess <i>Nazar</i>&nbsp; was passed over
          for rule in favor of his younger brother <i>Al - Musta'li</i>.
          <br>
          After a brief power struggle, prince Nazar was executed. And Nazar follower were force to flee east into 
          <i>Persia</i>. Thre they founded a new branch of Shia Islam called <i>Nizari Ismalism</i>,
          under the guidance of a charismatic missionary by the name of <i>Hassan i-Sabbah</i>.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;
          But life wasn't easy for the followers of this new doctrine, and at the time persia was
          occupied by the powerful <i>Seljuk Empire</i>, as <i>Sunni</i> Muslims the seljuk considered nazari 
          beliefs to be heretical a view that was also shared by the country's sheer minority.
          <br>
          And Hassan spent years travelling persia discreetly spreading the word of Nizari Ismalism, and attracting new
          followers to the course.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;
          Soon enough Hassan just found the place <i>Alamut Castle</i> which served as the
          Assassin's headquarters.
